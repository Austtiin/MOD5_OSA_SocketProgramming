/*
* Overview:
Socket programming refers to writing programs that execute across multiple computers in which the devices are connected to
* each other through a network, specifically using the TCP or UDP protocols over TCP/IP. In
*  this exercise, demonstrates how to write a client/server application in Java.



Instructions:
Write a Java program:

That emulates a client/server application running on your local host (127.0.0.1).
*
Where there is two-way communication between client and server: client sends message to server and server responds with
* acknowledgement and current date and time
*
Where server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, e.g., multiple threads running
Outputs client/server
